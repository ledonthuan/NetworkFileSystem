//// My own rating on the functionality ///////////////////
Rating: B
Explanation: The overall design of the code is not good because it is written very intuitively and with little finesse to how it should be designed. This lead to bulkiness in the code and this most likely created code that was not optimized to be the best and with a higher time complexity.

Program has some faulty functions that are not working properly: cat and rm do not work as they should and rmdir does not check if the directory is not empty
